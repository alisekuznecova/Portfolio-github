                <p class="pme">I am a latvian girl, currently trying to find my place, exploring the possibilities and aiming for the skies. One thing i love to do the most is to dance-in the club, dance hall, kitchen...wherever. Visual arts, design is my second biggest passion, which is the reason, why i am studying here-at KEA. I love to create and to capture the moment, thatâ€™s why i especielly enjoy video art- then i feel powerful and mighty, because i can create a feeling of the moment myself and i am the one deciding, what exactly the viewer will feel while watching it. Apart from arts, i also adore nature, that works like a life battery for me-too long without it and i will slowly start to shut down.. My work and study experience is not impressively big, but i see that as a constant and wonderful reminder, that i still have a plenty of space to grow and develop myself.<br>
